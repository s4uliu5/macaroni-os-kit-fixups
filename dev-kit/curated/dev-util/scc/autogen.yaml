          # This project has a release with a large integer name:
          # '92605' or something. We want '3.1.0.'. Here's the fix:
          # This match ensures we get a 0-9, followed by '.' and
          # ignore big numbers that might mistakenly be chosen as
          # "latest release".
          match: '([0-9]\..*)'
