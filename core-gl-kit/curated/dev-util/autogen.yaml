        # Note: upstream now has GitHub JSON tag_name with timestamp and name with release version in it.
        #       We will likely need some extension to the github API to deal with this and grab the name
        #       instead of tag_name if we want to continue doing this. This started with version 2.0.17.
        #
        # Note: version 2.0.17 (2022-05-18) requires a new opencl-icd-loader dependency to build and
        #            has updated build instructions located at:
        #
        #            https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP
        #
        #            (Notice reference to new OpenCL-ICD-Loader build dependency. We should add that
        #             autogen to this file.)
        #
        # Note: opencl-clhpp currently depends on opencl-headers-${PV}. This dependency only works if 
        #       the versions "match", which is not currently the case.
        #
        # Note: Seemant recently did some work on vulkan to ensure things were properly "synchronized"
        #       and built to upstream standards (using the correct versions of packages for everything.)
        #       It may be a good idea if we can look for JSON within the releases to do the same thing
        #       here.
        #
        # Note: I also noticed that when using the github-1 generator, for releases you have to use 
        # "select:" whereas tags allow you to use the simpler "version:" to lock a version. I should
        # open a bug for this and fix this.
        #
        select: v2.0.16
