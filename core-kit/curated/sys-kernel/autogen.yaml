#
# Use the following structure for storing patches:
#
# debian-sources(-lts)/files/latest <-- this is where the most current version of the patch lives
# debian-sources(-lts)/files/x.y.z  <-- this is where you put a patch variant that a specific kernel needs
#
# Above, the 'x.y.z' version of the patch will always override the 'latest' version, if it exists.
# This way, we have all the patches we hope will work for autogen in 'latest', and we can keep older
# variants around for older kernels.
#
# Below, under debian-sources-lts, there is an 'unmask_match' field. We are going to auto-unmask debian-sources-lts
# kernels as long as their version starts with this string. Otherwise, Debian has moved to a brand new LTS
# kernel and we need to review that before it goes live.
