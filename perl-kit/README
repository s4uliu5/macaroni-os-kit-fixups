While it is possible to add ebuilds here, it's preferred to add them to:

   https://code.funtoo.org/bitbucket/projects/CORE/repos/perl-kit-sources/browse

This standalone repository is organized in separate branches and supports
autogens.

NOTE: Since perl-kit has a packages.yaml, you will also need to update the 
packages.yaml in this directory to "allow" any added packages into Funtoo.
