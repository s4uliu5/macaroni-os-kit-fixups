# There is a documented dependency on XML_Parser, but that's only needed
# for development -- if you want to *generate* the PHP class files. The
# ones in the release are already pre-generated. The dependency on the
# XML_Serializer, on the other hand, is not documented but is requird
# by the XML output renderer.
